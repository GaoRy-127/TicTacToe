   > 2. Coordinate input function   
   > 3. Win/lose Judgment function
   
   ```
        int slash(int n);		//줄 함수
        void plane();		//좌표 입력받는 함수
        int coin(int n);		//승,패,무승부 판정 함수
    ```
   > In this way you should make 'Excel file' and input values there. That's what I do.
   
        
   > Or You can get A and b directly
   ```
        coe = [A1 A2 A3 (...); (...); ];     
        con = [b1 ; b2; b3; (...) ];  
    ```

   > Actually, there is better way to solve simultaneous equation
   > You can use "backslash \\"      
   ```
        Xprof= (coe\con).'

   > If you add this line to your script file, you can see that answer is same.


## Others..   
 * I uploaded only function m-file. So, you should write your own script m-file. 
 * I made this code to do my college assignment.   
 * I use Excel to input values, because it is inconvenient to enter a matrix in a matlab.
 * I am hoping that my code can help other undergraduate students' assignments.
